In \\nthe last three decades, India \\nhas not just grown faster; but \\nhas also compressed the GDP \\ngrowth of the earlier decades into \\nfewer years. India is expected to \\ntransition from a USD 3.75 trillion \\neconomy to a USD 5 trillion \\neconomy in the next few years.\\nAt Adani portfolio of companies, \\nwe proactively invested in \\nbusinesses that are expected \\nto ride India’s middle-income \\nconsumption engine. The Adani \\nportfolio of companies invested \\nnot on the basis of what is, but \\non what can be. By making \\ndisproportionate investments, it \\nintends to shift the needle not \\njust for its investee Company but \\nfor the country as a whole - with \\nthe objective of extending access, \\nreducing costs, widening the \\nmarket and, in doing so, helping \\nstrengthen India.\\nCompetitive advantage: At the \\nAdani portfolio of companies, \\nwe believe that the ability to \\nmake a significant national contribution can only be derived \\nfrom a broadbased competitive \\nadvantage that is not dependent \\non any one factor but is the result \\nof an overarching culture of \\nexcellence – the coming together \\nof adjacent businesses, deep \\nsectorial experience, ability to \\ncommission projects faster than \\nthe sectorial curve, competence \\nto do so at a cost lower than the \\nindustry average, foresight to \\nnot merely service the market \\nbut to grow it, establish decisive \\nsustainable leadership and evolve \\nthe Company’s position into a \\ngeneric name within the sector.\\nRelatively non-mature spaces: \\nThe Adani portfolio of companies \\nhas entered businesses that may \\nbe considered ‘maturely non-\\nmature’. Some of the businesses \\ncan be classified as mature, \\nbased on the enduring industry \\npresence and the conventional \\ninterpretation of their market \\npotential; these businesses can \\nbe considered non-mature by the \\nvirtue of their vast addressable \\nmarket potential and the superior Adani portfolio of companies \\nvalue proposition.

Technology Absorption:\\n(i) the efforts made towards technology absorption:\\n- Heavy capital investment of approx. H92 Crores in FY 2022-23 was made to introduce the Dozer push \\ntechnology. This will also conserve fuel per BCM of Over burden (“OB”) removal. This technology is meant \\nfor OB removal in semi-autonomous mode operating remotely with the help of IT-OT convergence.\\n- Dozer push method has below advantages over the conventional Dumper-Tipper method.\\n yOne dozer will replace a minimum of two fleet of dumper tipper i.e. 2 excavators and 5 dumpers / \\ntippers. Thus, there is reduction in crowding of equipment in mining.\\n yReduced number of manpower reduces work safety hazards.ADANI ENTERPRISES LIMITED\\nANNUAL REPORT 2022-23 122\", start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Looking ahead, it is \\nanticipated that India’s coal requirement will reach 1.5 \\nbillion tonnes by 2030, which will require sustained \\nefforts to increase coal production and improve coal \\nuse efficiency.\\nIndia’s coal production experienced a significant \\nincrease of 16.39% during 2022-23. This growth is \\nattributed to mining reforms and a growing focus on \\nmineral-based downstream metal manufacturing.

Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy \\nadopted by your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes \\nand the practices adopted to manage such wastes.\\n Our waste management is based on the cradle-to-cradle concept wherein the focus is on Refuse, Reduce, \\nReuse, Repurpose and Recycle the waste back into the system. It also comprises of five stages – Identification, \\nStorage, Segregation, Recycling and Disposal. Our waste management system implies use of best-in-class \\nwaste management practices as it forms an integral part of our environmental management system. We \\nalso have a policy on Resource Conservation which has been effectively implemented at individual AEL \\nbusinesses.\\n For handling hazardous waste, we strictly adhere to applicable regulatory requirements and adopt best \\npractices in the industry. This includes proper segregation, storage, and transportation of hazardous waste. \\nIn line with regulations, we ensure that hazardous waste is disposed of in an environmentally responsible \\nmanner through authorized vendors who specialize in recycling such waste.\\n All our businesses are actively working towards achieving Zero Waste to Landfill certification wherever \\nit is viable. In addition to hazardous waste, various non-hazardous waste streams are significant, such as \\noverburden from mining sites, scrap metal, wood waste, glass, tires, e-waste, cardboard, and paper. The \\nentire overburden is used within the mining lease areas for backfilling and ecosystem restoration. Our \\nstrategic objective is to minimize or eliminate waste generation and divert waste from disposal through \\nthe promotion of reuse and recycling whenever feasible.

Similarly, at Thiruvananthapuram International Airport, we have installed an advanced Bioenergy \\nPlant wherein the Biogas generated from the process is converted into electricity using the 15 KVA Biogas \\nGenset and the generated units is consumed for operating the Airport. The Biogas slurry generated from \\nthe process is used as manure for Horticultural purposes. Also, at Mumbai and Ahmedabad Airport, we have \\ninstalled three Reverse Vending Machines (RVM) to urge passengers and airport staff to recycle plastic \\nbottles.

G. Highway, Khodiyar, Ahmedabad - 382421, Gujarat, India. \\nIts shares are listed on the BSE Limited and National Stock Exchange of India Limited. The Company is in the \\nbusiness of integrated resource management, mining services and other trading activities. The Company \\noperates as an incubator, establishing new businesses in various areas like new energy ecosystem, data \\ncenter, airports, roads, copper, digital, food FMCG and others.\\n2 Significant Accounting Policies\\nI Basis of Preparation\\na) Statement of Compliance\\n The financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with Indian Accounting \\nStandards (Ind AS) notified under section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 read with the Companies (Indian \\nAccounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended from time to time and other accounting principles generally \\naccepted in India.\\n These financial statements have been prepared and presented under the historical cost convention with \\nthe exception of certain assets and liabilities that are required to be carried at fair values by Ind AS. Fair \\nvalue is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction \\nbetween the market participants at the measurement date.\\n The financial statements are presented in INR except when otherwise stated. All amounts have been \\nrounded-off to the nearest crore, unless otherwise indicated and amounts less than H 50,000/- have been \\npresented as “0.00”.\\nb) Use of Estimates and Judgements\\n The preparation of financial statements in conformity with Ind AS requires management to make certain \\njudgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets \\nand liabilities (including contingent liabilities) and the accompanying disclosures. Future results could differ \\ndue to these estimates and differences between the actual results and the estimates are recognised in the \\nperiods in which the results are known / materialised. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed \\non an ongoing basis.\\nKey sources of estimation uncertainty\\n The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting \\ndate, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and \\nliabilities within the next financial year, are described below. Existing circumstances and assumptions about \\nfuture developments may change due to market changes or circumstances arising that are beyond the \\ncontrol of the Company. Such changes are reflected in the assumptions when they occur.\\nSignificant estimates and assumptions are required in particular for:\\n i) Useful life of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets:\\n This involves determination of the estimated useful life of property, plant and equipment and intangible \\nassets and the assessment as to which components of the cost may be capitalised. Useful life of \\nthese assets is based on the life prescribed in Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013 or based on \\ntechnical estimates, taking into account the nature of the asset, estimated usage, expected residual \\nvalues, anticipated technological changes, maintenance support and operating conditions of the asset. \\nManagement reviews its estimate of the useful lives of depreciable/ amortisable assets at each reporting \\ndate, based on the expected utility of the assets.', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

The fair value \\nless costs of disposal calculation is based on available data for similar assets or observable market \\nprices less incremental costs for disposing of the asset. The value in use calculation is based on a \\ndiscounted future cashflows model. The recoverable amount is sensitive to the discount rate used for \\nthe discounted future cashflows model as well as the expected future cash-inflows and the growth rate \\nused.\\niii) Taxes:\\n The Company’s tax jurisdiction is India. Significant judgements are involved in estimating budgeted \\nprofits for the purpose of paying advance tax, determining the provision for income taxes, including \\namount expected to be paid/recovered for uncertain tax positions. Significant management judgement \\nis also required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognised, based upon the \\nlikely timing and the level of future taxable profits together with future tax planning strategies, including \\nestimates of temporary differences reversing on account of available benefits from the Income Tax Act, \\n1961.\\niv) Fair value measurement of financial instruments:\\n In estimating the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities, the Company uses market \\nobservable data to the extent available. Where such Level 1 inputs are not available, the Company \\nestablishes appropriate valuation techniques and inputs to the model. The inputs to these models are \\ntaken from observable markets where possible, but where this is not feasible, a degree of judgment is \\nrequired in establishing fair values. Judgments include considerations of inputs such as liquidity risk, \\ncredit risk and volatility. Changes in assumptions about these factors could affect the reported fair \\nvalue of financial instruments.\\nv) Defined benefit plans (Gratuity Benefits):\\n The cost of the defined benefit gratuity plan and the present value of the gratuity obligation are \\ndetermined using actuarial valuations. An actuarial valuation involves making various assumptions that \\nmay differ from actual developments in the future. These include the determination of the discount \\nrate, future salary increases, attrition rate and mortality rates. Due to the complexities involved in the \\nvaluation and its long-term nature, a defined benefit obligation is highly sensitive to changes in these \\nassumptions. All assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date.\\nvi) Inventory Measurement\\n Measurement of bulk inventory quantities of coal lying at port/ yards is material, complex and involves \\nsignificant judgement and estimate resulting from measuring the surface area. The Company performs \\nphysical counts of above inventory on a periodic basis using internal / external experts to perform \\nvolumetric surveys and assessments, basis which the estimate of quantity for these inventories is \\ndetermined. The variations noted between book records and physical quantities of above inventories \\nare evaluated and appropriately accounted in the books of accounts.\\nvii) Determination of lease term & discount rate :\\n Ind AS 116 Leases requires lessee to determine the lease term as the non-cancellable period of a lease \\nadjusted with any option to extend or terminate the lease, if the use of such option is reasonably \\ncertain. The Company makes assessment on the expected lease term on lease by lease basis and \\nthereby assesses whether it is reasonably certain that any options to extend or terminate the contract \\nwill be exercised. In evaluating the lease term, the Company considers factors such as any significant \\nleasehold improvements undertaken over the lease term, costs relating to the termination of lease and \\nthe importance of the underlying to the Company’s operations taking into account the location of the \\nunderlying asset and the availability of the suitable alternatives. The lease term in future periods is \\nreassessed to ensure that the lease term reflects the current economic circumstances.', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

The recognition and measurement of asset retirement obligations \\ninvolves the use of estimates and assumptions, viz. the timing of abandonment of site facilities \\nwhich would depend upon the ultimate life of the project, expected utilization of assets in other \\nprojects, the scope of abandonment activity and pre-tax rate applied for discounting.\\nix) Recognition and measurement of Contingent liabilities, provisions and uncertain tax positions:\\n There are various legal, direct and indirect tax matters and other obligations including local and \\nstate levies, availing input tax credits etc., which may impact the Company. Evaluation of uncertain \\nliabilities and contingent liabilities arising out of above matters and recognition and measurement \\nof other provisions are based on the assessment of the probability of an outflow of resources, and \\non past experience and circumstances known at the balance sheet date. The actual outflow of \\nresources at a future date may therefore vary from the figure included in other provisions.\\nc) Current & Non-Current Classification\\nAny asset or liability is classified as current if it satisfies any of the following conditions:\\ni) The asset/liability is expected to be realized/settled in the Company’s normal operating cycle;\\nii) The asset is intended for sale or consumption;\\niii) The asset/liability is held primarily for the purpose of trading;\\niv) The asset/liability is expected to be realized/settled within twelve months after the reporting period;\\nv) The asset is cash or cash equivalent unless it is restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a \\nliability for at least twelve months after the reporting date;\\nvi) In the case of a liability, the Company does not have an unconditional right to defer settlement of the \\nliability for at least twelve months after the reporting date.\\n All other assets and liabilities are classified as non-current. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified \\nas non-current assets and liabilities respectively.\\n For the purpose of current/non-current classification of assets and liabilities, the Company has ascertained \\nits normal operating cycle as twelve months. This is based on the nature of services and the time between \\nthe acquisition of assets or inventories for processing and their realization in cash and cash equivalents.\\nII Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\\na) Foreign Currency Transactions and Translation\\ni) Functional and presentation currency\\nThe financial statements are presented in Indian Rupee (INR), which is entity’s functional and \\npresentation currency.\\nii) Transactions and Balances\\nForeign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency, for initial recognition, using \\nthe exchange rates at the dates of the transactions.\\nAll foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rates \\non the reporting date.

If \\nany such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the \\nextent of the impairment loss (if any). When it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an \\nindividual asset, the Company estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit (CGU) to \\nwhich the asset belongs. Each CGU represents the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows \\nthat are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or CGUs. When a reasonable and consistent \\nbasis of allocation can be identified, corporate assets are also allocated to individual cash-generating units, \\nor otherwise they are allocated to the smallest group of cash-generating units for which a reasonable and \\nconsistent allocation basis can be identified.\\n Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. In assessing value in \\nuse, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that \\nreflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which \\nthe estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.\\n If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying \\namount, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. \\nAn impairment loss is recognised immediately in the Statement of Profit or Loss.\\n Assets (other than goodwill) for which impairment loss has been recognised in prior periods, the Company \\nreviews at each reporting date whether there is any indication that the loss has decreased or no longer exists. \\nWhen an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or a cash-generating \\nunit) is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, so that the increased carrying amount \\ndoes not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been \\nrecognised. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in Statement of Profit and Loss.\\n Impairment is determined for goodwill by assessing the recoverable amount of CGU to which such goodwill \\nrelates. When the recoverable amount of the CGU is less than its carrying amount, an impairment loss is \\nrecognised. Impairment losses relating to goodwill cannot be reversed in future periods.\\nh) Investment in Subsidiaries, Jointly Controlled Entities, Associates and Unincorporated Entities\\n Investment in Subsidiaries, Joint Controlled Entities and Associates are measured at cost less impairment in \\naccordance with Ind AS 27 “Separate Financial Statements”.\\n In case of unincorporated entities in the nature of a Joint Operation, the Company recognizes its direct \\nright and its share of jointly held or incurred assets, liabilities, contingent liabilities, revenues and expenses ', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

The Company assesses on a \\nforward looking basis the expected credit losses associated with its receivables based on historical \\ntrends and past experience.\\n The Company follows ‘Simplified Approach’ for recognition of impairment loss allowance on all \\ntrade receivables or contractual receivables. Under the simplified approach the Company does not \\ntrack changes in credit risk, but it recognises impairment loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at \\neach reporting date, right from its initial recognition. For recognition of impairment loss on other \\nfinancial assets and risk exposure, the group determines that whether there has been a significant \\nincrease in the credit risk since initial recognition. If credit risk has not increased significantly, 12 \\nmonth ECL is used to provide for impairment loss. However, if credit risk has increased significantly, \\nlifetime ECL is used.\\n ECL is the difference between all contracted cash flows that are due to the Company in accordance \\nwith the contract and all the cash flows that the Company expects to receive, discounted at the \\noriginal EIR. ECL impairment loss allowance (or reversal) recognised during the period is recognised \\nas income / (expense) in the Statement of Profit and Loss.\\n B) Financial Liabilities\\n Financial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition as at amortised cost or fair value through profit \\nor loss. The measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification, as described below:\\n1) At amortised cost\\n This is the category most relevant to the Company. After initial recognition, financial liabilities are \\nsubsequently measured at amortised cost using the EIR method. Gains and losses are recognised \\nin Statement of Profit and Loss when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the EIR \\namortisation process. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium \\non acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included \\nas finance costs in the Statement of Profit and Loss.\\n The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability \\nand of allocating interest expense over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that \\nexactly discounts estimated future cash payments (including all fees and points paid or received \\nthat form an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and other premiums or \\ndiscounts) through the expected life of the financial liability, or (where appropriate) a shorter period, \\nto the net carrying amount on initial recognition.\\n 2) At fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL)\\n Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include financial liabilities held for trading and \\nfinancial liabilities designated upon initial recognition as such. Subsequently, any changes in fair value \\nare recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.\\nDerecognition of Financial Liability\\n A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or \\nexpires. The difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the Statement of Profit and \\nLoss. An exchange with a lender of debt instruments with substantially different terms is accounted for \\nas an extinguishment of the original financial liability and the recognition of a new financial liability.

Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised and \\nsubsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL). Derivatives are carried as financial \\nassets when the fair value is positive and as financial liabilities when the fair value is negative.\\n Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivative financial instrument are recognised \\nin the Statement of Profit and Loss and reported with foreign exchange gains/(loss). Changes in fair \\nvalue and gains/(losses) on settlement of foreign currency derivative financial instruments relating to \\nborrowings, which have not been designated as hedge are recorded as finance cost.\\nj) Income Taxes\\n Income tax expense comprises current tax expense and the net change in the deferred tax asset or liability \\nduring the year. Current and deferred taxes are recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss, except when \\nthey relate to items that are recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which \\ncase, the current and deferred tax are also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, \\nrespectively.\\ni) Current Tax\\n Current income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from \\nor paid to the taxation authorities. Current income tax(including Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT)) is \\nmeasured at the amount expected to be paid to the tax authorities in accordance with the Income-Tax \\nAct, 1961 enacted in India. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are \\nenacted or substantially enacted, at the reporting date.\\n Current income tax relating to items recognised outside the statement of profit and loss is recognised \\noutside the statement of profit and loss (either in other comprehensive income (OCI) or in equity). \\nManagement periodically evaluates positions taken in the tax returns with respect to situations in which \\napplicable tax regulations are subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where appropriate.\\nii) Deferred Tax\\n Deferred tax is recognised using the Balance Sheet approach. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are \\nrecognised for deductible and taxable temporary differences arising between the tax base of assets and \\nliabilities and their carrying amount, except when the deferred tax arises from the initial recognition of \\nan asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and affects neither accounting \\nnor taxable profit or loss at the time of the transaction.\\n Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available \\nagainst which the deductible temporary differences, and the carry forward of unused tax credits and \\nunused tax losses can be utilised. The carrying amount of unrecognised deferred tax assets are reviewed \\nat each reporting date to assess their realisability and corresponding adjustment is made to carrying \\nvalues of deferred tax assets in the financial statements.\\n Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year \\nwhen the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been \\nenacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.\\n Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where a legally enforceable right exists to offset current \\ntax assets and liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation \\nauthority. Net outstanding balance in Deferred Tax account is recognized as deferred tax liability/asset.\\n Deferred tax includes MAT tax credit.

If the effect of the time value of money \\nis material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects, when appropriate, the \\nrisks specific to the liability.

A contract is, \\nor contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of \\ntime in exchange for consideration.\\n Company as a lessee\\n The Company recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The \\nright-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability \\nadjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs \\nincurred and an estimate of costs to dismantle and remove the underlying asset or to restore the site on \\nwhich it is located, less any lease incentives received.\\n Certain lease arrangements include the option to extend or terminate the lease before the end of the lease \\nterm. The right-of-use assets and lease liabilities include these options when it is reasonably certain that \\nthe option will be exercised.\\n The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement \\ndate to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the right-of-use asset or the end of the lease term. In \\naddition, the right-of-use asset is periodically reduced by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain \\nre-measurements of the lease liability.\\n The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the \\ncommencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be \\nreadily determined, the Company’s incremental borrowing rate. Generally, the Company uses its incremental \\nborrowing rate as the discount rate.\\n The lease liability is subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. It is \\nremeasured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, if \\nthere is a change in the Company’s estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value \\nguarantee, or if there is a change in the lease payments or a change in the assessment of an option to \\npurchase the underlying asset.', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

The Company recognises the lease payments associated with these leases as an expense in \\nstatement of profit and loss over the lease term. The related cash flows are classified as operating activities.\\n Company as a lessor\\n Leases in which the Company does not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of an \\nasset are classified as operating leases. Rental income from operating lease is recognised on a straight-line \\nbasis over the term of the relevant lease. Contingent rents are recognised as revenue in the period in which \\nthey are earned.\\n Leases are classified as finance leases when substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership transfer \\nfrom the Company to the lessee. Amounts due from lessees under finance leases are recorded as receivables \\nat the Companies net investment in the leases. Finance lease income is allocated to accounting periods so \\nas to reflect a constant periodic rate of return on the net investment outstanding in respect of the lease.\\nq) Earnings Per Share\\n Basic EPS is computed by dividing the profit or loss attributable to the owners of the Company by the \\nweighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the year. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing \\nthe profit or loss attributable to the owners of the Company (after adjusting for costs associated with \\ndilutive potential equity shares) by the weighted average number of equity shares and dilutive potential \\nequity shares outstanding during the year.\\nr) Service Work in Progress\\n Service Work in Progress is valued at lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined based on \\nWeighted Average Cost Method.\\n Service Work in Progress represents closing inventory of Washed Coal, which is not owned by the Company as \\nper the terms of Mine Development and Operation (MDO) contract. Hence, this represents work performed \\nunder contractual liability in bringing this inventory to its present condition and location.\\n Net realisable value is the contract price as per the MDO Agreement, less estimated costs of completion and \\nestimated costs necessary to make the sale.\\ns) Overburden Cost Adjustment\\n Overburden removal expenses incurred during production stage are charged to revenue based on waste-\\nto-ore ratio, (commonly known as Stripping Ratio in the industry). This ratio is taken based on the current \\noperational phase of overall mining area. To the extent the current period ratio exceeds the expected \\nStripping Ratio of a phase, excess overburden costs are deferred.\\nt) Expenditure\\n Expenses are net of taxes recoverable, where applicable.', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Under the Act, every employee who has completed at least five year of service is entitled to \\ngratuity benefits on departure at 15 days of basic salary (last drawn basic salary) for each completed \\nyear of service. The scheme is funded with contributions to insurers (LIC and SBI) in form of a qualifying \\ninsurance policy.\\n Aforesaid post-employment benefit plans typically expose the Company to actuarial risks such as: \\ninvestment risk, interest rate risk, longevity risk and salary risk\\nInvestment Risk: These Plans invest in long term debt instruments such as Government securities and highly \\nrated corporate bonds. The valuation of which is inversely proportionate to the interest \\nrate movements. There is risk of volatility in asset values due to market fluctuations and \\nimpairment of assets due to credit losses.\\nInterest Risk: The present value of the defined benefit liability is calculated using a discount rate \\nwhich is determined by reference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on \\nGovernment securities. A decrease in yields will increase the fund liabilities and vice-\\nversa.\\nLongevity Risk: The present value of the defined benefit liability is calculated by reference to the best \\nestimate of the mortality of plan participants both during and after their employment. An \\nincrease in the life expectancy of the plan participants will increase the plan's liability.\\nSalary Risk: The present value of the defined benefit liability is calculated by reference to the future \\nsalaries of plan participants. As such, an increase in salary of the plan participants will \\nincrease the plan's liability.\", start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

The assessment \\nof a provision or a contingent liability requires \\nsignificant judgement by the management because \\nof the inherent complexity in estimating future \\ncosts. The amount recognized as a provision is the \\nbest estimate of the expenditure. The provisions \\nand contingent liabilities are subject to changes \\nin the outcomes of litigations and claims and the \\npositions taken by the management. It involves \\nsignificant judgement and estimation to determine \\nthe likelihood and timing of the cash outflows and \\ninterpretations of the legal aspects, tax legislations \\nand judgements previously made by authorities.\\nAssessment of provisions arising from ongoing tax \\nlitigations is also determined as a Key Audit Matter \\nin one of the components, namely New Delhi \\nTelevision Limited.Principal Audit Procedures\\nWe have obtained an understanding of the process \\nfollowed by the management for assessment and \\ndetermination of the amounts of provisions and \\ncontingent liabilities relating to taxation, litigations \\nand claims.\\nWe have made inquiries about the status in respect \\nof significant provisions and contingent liabilities \\nwith the Group’s internal tax and legal team, \\nincluding challenging the assumptions and critical \\njudgements made by the Group which impacted the \\ncomputation of the provisions and inspecting the \\ncomputation.\\nWe assessed management’s conclusions through \\ndiscussions held with their in-house legal counsel \\nand understanding precedents in similar cases. \\nWe communicated with the group’s external \\nlegal counsel on the certain material litigations \\nto establish likelihood of outflow of economic \\nresources being probable, possible or remote in \\nrespect of the litigations.\\nWe have involved subject matter experts with \\nspecialized skills and knowledge to assist in the \\nassessment of the value of significant provisions \\nand contingent liabilities relating to the pending \\nlitigations, on sample basis, in light of the nature of \\nthe exposures, applicable regulations and related \\ncorrespondence with the authorities.\\nWe also assessed and validated the adequacy \\nand appropriateness of the disclosures made by \\nthe management in the Consolidated financial \\nstatements.\\n2 Timing of Revenue recognition and adjustments for \\ncoal quality variances involving critical estimates\\nMaterial estimation by the Parent is involved in \\nrecognition and measurement of its revenue.

G. Highway, Khodiyar, Ahmedabad - 382421, Gujarat, India. Its \\nshares are listed on the BSE Limited and the National Stock Exchange of India Limited.

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an \\norderly transaction between the market participants at the measurement date.\\n The financial statements are presented in INR except when otherwise stated. All amounts have been \\nrounded-off to the nearest Crore, unless otherwise indicated and amounts less than H50,000/- have been \\npresented as “0.00”.\\nb) Principles of Consolidation\\n The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Company, its subsidiaries \\nand equity accounting of its investment in associates and jointly controlled entities.\\n Control is achieved when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with \\nthe investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. Specifically, the \\nGroup controls an investee if and only if the Group has:-\\n \\x83Power over the investee (i.e. existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities \\nof the investee)\\n \\x83Exposure or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and\\n \\x83The ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns\\n Generally, there is a presumption that a majority of voting rights result in control. To support this presumption \\nand when the Group has less than a majority of the voting or similar rights of an investee, the Group considers \\nall relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether it has power over an investee, including:\\n \\x83Rights arising from other contractual arrangements\\n \\x83The Group’s voting rights and potential voting rights\\n \\x83The size of the group’s holding of voting rights relative to the size and dispersion of the holdings of the \\nother voting rights holders.\\nThe Group re-assesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there \\nare changes to one or more of the three elements of control. Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the \\nGroup obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the Group loses control of the subsidiary. Assets, \\nliabilities, income and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed off during the year are included in the \\nconsolidated financial statements from the date the Group gains control until the date the Group ceases to \\ncontrol the subsidiary.', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

If a member of the group uses accounting policies other \\nthan those adopted in the consolidated financial statements, appropriate adjustments are made to \\nthat group member’s financial statements in preparing the consolidated financial statements to ensure \\nconformity with the group’s accounting policies.\\nThe financial statements of all the entities used for the purpose of consolidation are drawn up to same \\nreporting date as that of the parent company. When the end of the reporting period of the parent is \\ndifferent from that of a subsidiary, jointly controlled entities or associate, the respective entity prepares, \\nfor consolidation purposes, additional financial information as of the same date as the financial \\nstatements of the parent to enable the parent to consolidate the financial information of the said entity, \\nunless it is impracticable to do so.\\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the following basis.\\n  Subsidiaries\\nSubsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when the \\nGroup is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its power and involvement with the investee and \\nhas the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee.\\nSubsidiaries are considered for consolidation when the Group obtains control over the subsidiary and \\nare derecognised when the Group loses control of the subsidiary. Subsidiaries have been consolidated \\non a line-by-line basis by adding together the book values of the like items of assets, liabilities, equity, \\nincome and expenses. Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains resulting on intra-\\ngroup transactions are eliminated in full. Unrealised losses resulting from intra-group transactions \\nare eliminated in arriving at the carrying amount of assets unless transaction provides an evidence of \\nimpairment of transferred asset.\\nNon-controlling interests represent the portion of profit or loss and net assets not held by the Group \\nand are presented separately in the Statement of Profit and Loss and Consolidated Balance Sheet, \\nseparately from parent shareholders’ equity, profit and loss and each component of other comprehensive \\nincome (OCI) are attributed to the equity holders of the parent of the Group and to the non-controlling \\ninterests, even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.\\nChanges in the Group’s ownership interests in subsidiaries that do not result in the Group losing control \\nover the subsidiaries are accounted for as equity transactions. The carrying amounts of the Group’s \\ninterests and the non-controlling interests are adjusted to reflect the changes in their relative interests \\nin the subsidiaries.\\n  Associates and Jointly Controlled Entities - Equity Accounting\\nAn associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence. Significant influence is the \\npower to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or \\njoint control over those policies.\\nA jointly controlled entity is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the \\narrangement have rights to the net assets of the joint arrangement. Joint control is the contractually \\nagreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant \\nactivities require unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.\\nThe results and assets and liabilities of associates and jointly controlled entities are incorporated \\nin the consolidated financial statements using the equity method of accounting. Under the equity \\nmethod, an investment in an associate or a jointly controlled entity is initially recognised at cost and \\nadjusted thereafter to recognise the Group’s share of post acquisition profits or losses and that of \\nother comprehensive income of the associate or jointly controlled entity. Distributions received from \\nan associate or a jointly controlled entity reduce the carrying amount of the investment. Unrealised \\ngains and losses resulting from transactions between the Group, Jointly Controlled Entity and Associate \\nentities are eliminated to the extent of the interest in the Jointly Controlled Entity and Associate entities.', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Future results could \\ndiffer due to these estimates and differences between the actual results and the estimates are recognised \\nin the periods in which the results are known / materialised. Estimates and underlying assumptions are \\nreviewed on an ongoing basis.\\nKey sources of estimation uncertainty\\n The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting \\ndate, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and \\nliabilities within the next financial year, are described below. Existing circumstances and assumptions about \\nfuture developments may change due to market changes or circumstances arising that are beyond the \\ncontrol of the Group. Such changes are reflected in the assumptions when they occur.\\nSignificant estimates and assumptions are required in particular for:\\n i) Useful life of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets:\\n This involves determination of the estimated useful life of property, plant and equipment and intangible \\nassets and the assessment as to which components of the cost may be capitalised. Useful life of \\nthese assets is based on the life prescribed in Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013 or based on \\ntechnical estimates, taking into account the nature of the asset, estimated usage, expected residual \\nvalues, anticipated technological changes, maintenance support and operating conditions of the \\nasset. Management reviews its estimate of the useful lives of depreciable / amortisable assets at each \\nreporting date, based on the expected utility of the assets.\\n ii) Impairment of Non Financial Asset :\\n Impairment exists when the carrying value of an asset or cash generating unit exceeds its recoverable \\namount, which is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. The fair value \\nless costs of disposal calculation is based on available data for similar assets or observable market \\nprices less incremental costs for disposing of the asset. The value in use calculation is based on a \\ndiscounted future cashflows model. The recoverable amount is sensitive to the discount rate used for \\nthe discounted future cashflows model as well as the expected future cash-inflows and the growth rate \\nused.\\niii) Taxes:\\n Significant judgements are involved in estimating budgeted profits for the purpose of paying advance \\ntax, determining the provision for income taxes, including amount expected to be paid / recovered for \\nuncertain tax positions. Significant management judgement is also required to determine the amount of \\ndeferred tax assets that can be recognised, based upon the likely timing and the level of future taxable \\nprofits together with future tax planning strategies, including estimates of temporary differences \\nreversing on account of available benefits from the tax laws applicable to respective entities.\\niv) Fair value measurement of financial instruments:\\n In estimating the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities, the Group uses market observable \\ndata to the extent available. Where such Level 1 inputs are not available, the Group establishes \\nappropriate valuation techniques and inputs to the model. The inputs to these models are taken from \\nobservable markets where possible, but where this is not feasible, a degree of judgment is required in \\nestablishing fair values. Judgments include considerations of inputs such as liquidity risk, credit risk and \\nvolatility. Changes in assumptions about these factors could affect the reported fair value of financial \\ninstruments.\\nv) Defined benefit plans:\\nThe cost of the defined benefit plan and the present value of the obligation are determined using \\nactuarial valuations. An actuarial valuation involves making various assumptions that may differ from \\nactual developments in the future. These include the determination of the discount rate, future salary ', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

All \\nassumptions are reviewed at each reporting date.\\nvi) Inventory Measurement:\\n Measurement of bulk inventory lying at ports / yards is material, complex and involves significant \\njudgement and estimate resulting from measuring the surface area. The Group performs physical \\ncounts of above inventory on a periodic basis using internal / external experts to perform volumetric \\nsurveys and assessments, basis which the estimate of quantity for these inventories is determined. The \\nvariations noted between book records and physical quantities of above inventories are evaluated and \\nappropriately accounted in the books of accounts.\\nvii) Determination of lease term & discount rate :\\n Ind AS 116 Leases requires lessee to determine the lease term as the non-cancellable period of a lease \\nadjusted with any option to extend or terminate the lease, if the use of such option is reasonably certain. \\nThe Group makes assessment on the expected lease term on lease by lease basis and thereby assesses \\nwhether it is reasonably certain that any options to extend or terminate the contract will be exercised. In \\nevaluating the lease term, the Group considers factors such as any significant leasehold improvements \\nundertaken over the lease term, costs relating to the termination of lease and the importance of the \\nunderlying to the Group’s operations taking into account the location of the underlying asset and the \\navailability of the suitable alternatives. The lease term in future periods is reassessed to ensure that the \\nlease term reflects the current economic circumstances.\\n The discount rate is generally based on the incremental borrowing rate specific to the lease being \\nevaluated or for a portfolio of leases with similar characteristics.\\nviii) Asset Retirement Obligation:\\nThe liability for asset retirement obligations are recognised when the Group has an obligation to perform \\nsite restoration activity. The recognition and measurement of asset retirement obligations involves \\nthe use of estimates and assumptions, viz. the timing of abandonment of site facilities which would \\ndepend upon the ultimate life of the project, expected utilization of assets in other projects, the scope \\nof abandonment activity and pre-tax rate applied for discounting.\\nix) Recognition and measurement of Contingent liabilities, provisions and uncertain tax positions:\\nThere are various legal, direct and indirect tax matters and other obligations including local and state \\nlevies, availing input tax credits etc., which may impact the Group. Evaluation of uncertain liabilities and \\ncontingent liabilities arising out of above matters and recognition and measurement of other provisions \\nare based on the assessment of the probability of an outflow of resources, and on past experience and \\ncircumstances known at the balance sheet date. The actual outflow of resources at a future date may \\ntherefore vary from the figure included in other provisions.\\nd) Current & Non-Current Classification\\nAny asset or liability is classified as current if it satisfies any of the following conditions :\\ni) The asset/liability is expected to be realised/settled in the Group’s normal operating cycle;\\nii) The asset is intended for sale or consumption;\\niii) The asset/liability is held primarily for the purpose of trading;\\niv) The asset/liability is expected to be realised/settled within twelve months after the reporting period;\\nv) The asset is cash or cash equivalent unless it is restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a \\nliability for at least twelve months after the reporting date;\\nvi) In the case of a liability, the Group does not have an unconditional right to defer settlement of the \\nliability for at least twelve months after the reporting date.', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Additionally, all exchange gains or losses on foreign currency borrowings taken prior to 1st April, \\n2016 which are related to the acquisition or construction of qualifying assets are adjusted in the \\ncarrying cost of such assets. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a \\nforeign currency are not retranslated.\\niii) Group Companies\\nOn consolidation, the assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated at the exchange rate \\nprevailing at the reporting date and their statements of profit and loss are translated using average \\nrate of exchange prevailing during the year, which approximates to the exchange rate prevailing at \\nthe transaction date. All resulting exchange differences arising on translation for consolidation are \\nrecognised in OCI.

When it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount \\nof an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit (CGU) \\nto which the asset belongs. Each CGU represents the smallest group of assets that generates cash \\ninflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or CGUs. When a reasonable \\nand consistent basis of allocation can be identified, corporate assets are also allocated to individual \\ncash-generating units, or otherwise they are allocated to the smallest group of cash-generating units \\nfor which a reasonable and consistent allocation basis can be identified.\\nii) Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. In assessing value \\nin use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount \\nrate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the \\nasset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.\\niii) If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying \\namount, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. \\nAn impairment loss is recognised immediately in the Statement of Consolidated Profit or Loss.\\niv) Assets (other than goodwill) for which impairment loss has been recognised in prior periods, the \\nGroup reviews at each reporting date whether there is any indication that the loss has decreased or \\nno longer exists. When an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset \\n(or a cash-generating unit) is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, so that the \\nincreased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined \\nhad no impairment loss been recognised. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in \\nConsolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.\\nv) Impairment is determined for goodwill by assessing the recoverable amount of CGU to which such \\ngoodwill relates.

The infrastructure \\nused in a concession are classified as an intangible asset or a financial asset, depending on the nature of \\nthe payment entitlements under the SCA. When the Company has an unconditional right to receive cash \\nor another financial asset from or at the direction of the grantor, such right is recognised as a financial \\nasset and is subsequently measured at amortised cost.

The Group assesses on a forward \\nlooking basis the expected credit losses associated with its receivables based on historical trends \\nand past experience.\\n The Group follows ‘Simplified Approach’ for recognition of impairment loss allowance on all trade \\nreceivables or contractual receivables. Under the simplified approach, the Group does not track \\nchanges in credit risk, but it recognises impairment loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each \\nreporting date, right from its initial recognition. For recognition of impairment loss on other financial \\nassets and risk exposure, the group determines that whether there has been a significant increase \\nin the credit risk since initial recognition. If credit risk has not increased significantly, 12 month ECL \\nis used to provide for impairment loss. However, if credit risk has increased significantly, lifetime ECL \\nis used.\\n ECL is the difference between all contracted cash flows that are due to the Group in accordance \\nwith the contract and all the cash flows that the Group expects to receive, discounted at the \\noriginal EIR. ECL impairment loss allowance (or reversal) recognised during the period is recognised \\nas income / (expense) in the Statement of Profit and Loss.\\n B) Financial Liabilities\\n Financial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition as at amortised cost or fair value through profit \\nor loss. The measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification, as described below:\\n  At amortised cost\\n This is the category most relevant to the Group. After initial recognition, financial liabilities are \\nsubsequently measured at amortised cost using the EIR method. Gains and losses are recognised in \\nStatement of Profit and Loss when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the EIR amortisation \\nprocess. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition \\nand fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included as finance costs \\nin the Statement of Profit and Loss.\\n The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and of \\nallocating interest expense over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly \\ndiscounts estimated future cash payments (including all fees and points paid or received that form an \\nintegral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and other premiums or discounts) through \\nthe expected life of the financial liability, or (where appropriate) a shorter period, to the net carrying \\namount on initial recognition.\\n  At fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL)\\n Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include financial liabilities held for trading and \\nfinancial liabilities designated upon initial recognition as such. Subsequently, any changes in fair value \\nare recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.\\n  Derecognition of Financial Liability\\n A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or \\nexpires. The difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the Statement of Profit and \\nLoss. An exchange with a lender of debt instruments with substantially different terms is accounted for \\nas an extinguishment of the original financial liability and the recognition of a new financial liability. \\nSimilarly, a substantial modification of the terms of an existing financial liability is accounted for as an \\nextinguishment of the original financial liability and the recognition of a new financial liability.', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Such derivative financial instruments are initially \\nrecognised and subsequently measured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as financial assets when \\nthe fair value is positive and as financial liabilities when the fair value is negative.\\n Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivative financial instrument are recognised \\nin the Statement of Profit and Loss and reported with foreign exchange gains/(loss). Changes in fair \\nvalue and gains/(losses) on settlement of foreign currency derivative financial instruments relating to \\nborrowings, which have not been designated as hedge are recorded as finance expense and those \\npertaining to the effective portion of cash flow hedges is recognised in OCI and later reclassified to \\nprofit or loss when the hedge item affects profit or loss or treated as basis adjustment if a hedged \\nforecast transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or non-financial \\nliability.\\nk) Hedge Accounting\\nFew Subsidiaries of the group designates certain hedging instruments, which include derivatives in respect \\nof foreign currency risk, as cash flow hedges. To qualify for hedge accounting, the hedging relationship \\nmust meet all of the following requirements:\\n \\x83 there is an economic relationship between the hedged items and the hedging instruments,\\n \\x83 the hedge ratio of the hedging relationship is the same as that resulting from the quantity of the hedged \\nitem that the entity actually hedges and the quantity of the hedging instrument that the entity actually \\nuses to hedge that quantity of hedged item.\\n \\x83 the effect of credit risk does not dominate the value changes that result from that economic relationship. \\nAt the inception of the hedge relationship, the entity documents the relationship between the hedging \\ninstrument and hedged item, along with its risk management objectives and its strategy for undertaking \\nvarious hedge transactions.\\nFurthermore, at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, it is documented whether the hedging \\ninstrument is highly effective in offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows of the hedged item attributable \\nto the hedged risk.\\n Cash flow hedges\\nAbove companies designate derivative contracts or non derivative financial assets / liabilities as hedging \\ninstruments to mitigate the risk of movement in interest rates and foreign exchange rates for foreign \\nexchange exposure on highly probable future cash flows attributable to a recognised asset or liability or \\nforecast cash transactions.\\nWhen a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedging instrument, the effective portion of changes in the \\nfair value of the derivative / hedging instruments is recognized in the cash flow hedging reserve being part \\nof other comprehensive income. The effective portion of cash flow hedges is adjusted to the lower of the \\ncumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument and the cumulative change in fair value of the hedged \\nitem.\\nAny ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognized immediately in the \\nStatement of Profit and Loss. If the hedging relationship no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, \\nthen hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively.\\nIf the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, the cumulative gain or loss on the \\nhedging instrument recognized in cash flow hedging reserve till the period the hedge was effective remains \\nin cash flow hedging reserve until the underlying transaction occurs. The cumulative gain or loss previously \\nrecognized in the cash flow hedging reserve is transferred to the Statement of Profit and Loss upon the \\noccurrence of the underlying transaction.', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Current and deferred taxes are recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss, except when \\nthey relate to items that are recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which \\ncase, the current and deferred tax are also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, \\nrespectively.\\ni) Current Income Tax\\n Provision for current tax is measured at the amount of tax expected to be payable on the taxable \\nincome for the year as determined in accordance with the provisions of the tax laws of the concerned \\njurisdiction. Current income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be \\nrecovered from or paid to the taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the \\namount are those that are enacted or substantially enacted, at the reporting date for each concerned \\njurisdiction.\\n Current income tax relating to items recognised outside the statement of profit and loss is recognised \\noutside the statement of profit and loss (either in other comprehensive income (OCI) or in equity). \\nThe Group periodically evaluates positions taken in the tax returns with respect to situations in which \\napplicable tax regulations are subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where appropriate.\\n Current tax assets and liabilities are offset where the Group has a legally enforceable right to offset and \\nintends either to settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.\\nii) Deferred Tax\\n Deferred tax is recognised using the Balance Sheet approach. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are \\nrecognised for deductible and taxable temporary differences arising between the tax base of assets and \\nliabilities and their carrying amount, except when the deferred tax arises from the initial recognition of \\nan asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and affects neither accounting \\nnor taxable profit or loss at the time of the transaction.\\n Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available \\nagainst which the deductible temporary differences, and the carry forward of unused tax credits and \\nunused tax losses can be utilised. The carrying amount of unrecognised deferred tax assets are reviewed \\nat each reporting date to assess their realisability and corresponding adjustment is made to carrying \\nvalues of deferred tax assets in the financial statements.\\n Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year \\nwhen the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been \\nenacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.\\n Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where a legally enforceable right exists to offset current \\ntax assets and liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation \\nauthority. Net outstanding balance in Deferred Tax account is recognized as deferred tax liability/asset \\nfor each individual subsidiary in the Group.\\n Deferred tax includes MAT tax credit. The Group recognises tax credits in the nature of MAT credit as \\nan asset only to the extent that there is convincing evidence that the Group will pay normal income \\ntax during the specified period, i.e., the period for which tax credit is allowed to be carried forward.

If the effect of the time value of money is \\nmaterial, provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects, when appropriate, the risks \\nspecific to the liability.

Financial instruments that are subject to credit risk principally consist of \\nLoans, Trade and Other Receivables, Cash & Cash Equivalents, Investments and Other Financial Assets. \\nThe carrying amounts of financial assets represent the maximum credit risk exposure.\\n Credit risk encompasses both, the direct risk of default and the risk of deterioration of creditworthiness \\nas well as concentration of risks. Credit risk is controlled by analysing credit limits and creditworthiness \\nof counter parties on continuous basis with appropriate approval mechanism for sanction of credit \\nlimits. Credit risk from balances with banks, financial institutions and investments is managed by the \\nGroup’s treasury team in accordance with the Company’s risk management policy. Cash and cash \\nequivalents and Bank deposits are placed with banks having good reputation, good past track record \\nand high quality credit rating and also reviews their credit-worthiness on an on-going basis.\\n Since the Group has a fairly diversified portfolio of receivables in terms of spread, no concentration risk \\nis foreseen.

The insurance Company, as part of the policy rules, makes payment of all gratuity outgoes happening \\nduring the year (subject to sufficiency of funds under the policy). Any deficit in the policy assets are funded \\nby the such companies. The policy helps mitigate the liquidity risk. However, being a cash accumulation \\nplan, the duration of assets is shorter compared to the duration of liabilities. Thus, the companies are \\nexposed to movement in interest rate (in particular, the significant fall in interest rates, which should result \\nin a increase in liability without corresponding increase in the asset).\\n(d) The estimate of future salary increase, considered in actuarial variation, take account of inflation, seniority, \\npromotion and other relevant factors, such as supply and demand in the employment market.\\n(e) The expected contribution to the fund in the next financial year is in line with current financial year.\\n* As the gratuity fund is managed by life insurance companies, details of fund invested by insurer are not \\navailable with the Group.\\n52 Earnings Per Share (EPS) (H In Crores)\\nParticularsFor the year ended\\n31st March, 2023For the year ended\\n31st March, 2022\\nConsolidated Net Profit After Tax attributable to the Owners (H in \\nCrores)2,472.94 776.56\\nWeighted Avg.
