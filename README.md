### Automated Machine Learning Algorithm Comparisons
Basic Idea :  User will give dataset and declare the independent variable, whole model will automatically, fill missing values if any and will do feature engineering of the categorical variables, detect where the problem is classification or regression and will run the model accordingly, and will provide comparison results of various Machine Learning Algorithms, currently limited to Binary classification and Regression problems. 

Key Softwares : Python, Predictive models, Label Encoder, Jupyter Notebook.

Created basic logic based algorithm to detect weather the dataset has any null values if  they have any null values it will impute those missing values based on normal median and mode imputation.
Created basic logic to detect weather the dependable variables is related to classification problem or Regression Problem and runs the model accordingly, without any human intervention, currently limited to Binary and Regression problems.

Future Work :  Working to upgrade the model removing all the limitation, where we just give tabular dataset and dependent variable where it will automatically identify weather it is Binary classification problem or Multilabel or Multiclass problem or timeseries problem, will show comparison models and choose the best hypertunned model based on the metrices score and make further prediction, without any human intervention.
